# GitHub action to automatically rebase PRs

[![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/cirrus-actions/rebase.svg)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/cirrus-actions/rebase) [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/version/cirrusactions/rebase.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/cirrusactions/rebase) [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/cirrusactions/rebase.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/cirrusactions/rebase)

After installation simply comment `/rebase` to trigger the action:

## Installation

To configure the action simply add the following lines to your `.github/main.workflow` workflow file:

```
workflow "Automatic Rebase" {
  on = "issue_comment"
  resolves = "Rebase"
}

action "Rebase" {
  uses = "docker://cirrusactions/rebase:latest"
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
}
```

## Restricting who can call the action

It's possible to use `author_association` field of a comment to restrict who can call the action and skip the rebase for others. Simply add the following expression to the `if` statement in your workflow file: `github.event.comment.author_association == 'MEMBER'`. See [documentation](https://developer.github.com/v4/enum/commentauthorassociation/) for a list of all available values of `author_association`.
